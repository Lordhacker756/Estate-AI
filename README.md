# Estate AI üè¢ü§ñ

Estate AI is a full-stack application that uses machine learning to predict the approximate rent a user would need to pay for their requirement across major metro cities of India. The application is built on NextJS 13 and TailwindCSS for the frontend and uses TypeScript for robust code. The backend was initially built on FastAPI but later migrated to Flask for easier deployment.

You can check the frontend of the site [Estate AI](https://estate-ai.vercel.app/)

## Features

- The application uses machine learning to predict the approximate rent a user would need to pay for their requirement.
- The model is trained using Scikit-Learn and with Random Forest Regressor Algorithm with 89% Accuracy.
- The frontend is built on NextJS 13 and TailwindCSS and uses TypeScript for robust code.
- The backend is built on Flask for easier deployment, previously it was on FastAPI

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, clone the repository to your local machine:
